# CS2263-Group-20

We have noticed that after playing for a long time, the game sometimes crashes with the following error: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
We need to investigate the cause and fix the memory management to prevent crashes.

I'm working on this project using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Some small adjustments are required to ensure smooth compilation on Linux.

I'm sorry About that
